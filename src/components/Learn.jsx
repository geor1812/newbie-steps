      mainText: `Newbie Steps core component is a "step sequencer", a common tool
      you will come across on almost all digital audio workstations.
      In a step sequencer, horizontal placement determines at which
      point in the loop the sound plays and vertical location
      determines the pitch of the note.`,
      secondText: `                Though not necessary in using it, understanding rhythm
      subdivisions is helpful, so here is a brief explanation: If you
      imagine yourself tapping your foot along to a song, generally
      the time between each tap is a beat. Typically, 4 beats make a
      bar. If you split the beat into 4 you get 1/16th of a bar so we
      call this division a 16th note. Our step sequencer is 2 bars
      long, giving you 8 beats and 32 16th notes.`,

      title: `Scale selector`,
      mainText: `Something not so common to see in a step sequencer is a scale selector. A scale is a set of pitches(notes) and the distance between these pitches 
      give a particular sound. By default, the sequencer displays a chromatic scale, ie every note on a piano. Selecting a scale will highlight
      only the notes in that scale, making it easier to develop a musical sounding melody. Different scales have different emotional impacts on the
      listener. Try out some different scales and see which ones you like the sound of.`,

The play/pause button requires no explanation. The upload button will open up a pop-up where you can name the track and the current layer while also allowing you to choose an image for your track, and see all relevant information. BPM refers to beats per minute, meaning that increasing the number will increase the speed of the song.`,

You will also notice the "Contribute" button, which if pressed will take you to the step sequencer and allow you to add another layer on top of the already existing ones.`,
